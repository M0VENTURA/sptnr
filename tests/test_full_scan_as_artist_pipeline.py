"""Regression tests for the dashboard 'All' scan aligned with the artist page.

Covers:
- ``_run_full_scan_as_artist_pipeline`` iterates over every artist, running
  the full artist pipeline for each, and reports % of total artists.
- A stop request halts the loop and marks the scan "stopped".
- ``run_popularity_mode(mode="all")`` routes to the per-artist loop (not the
  old single combined pass).
