"""Two-pass M_peak era-calibration regression tests.

The scanner previously rated each album IMMEDIATELY after its tracks scored.
During a single run the DB is populated progressively, so the FIRST album of
an artist was era-classified against a catalogue containing only its own fresh
scores (M_peak = its own median → era=peak with R_eff=1.0) while later albums
were rated against a catalogue that had grown to include the earlier albums'
stored scores → damped.  The fix defers per-album star posting to the
artist-section close, so by the time ANY album of the artist is rated ALL of
the artist's albums are persisted and M_peak is resolved catalog-wide.

These tests pin the invariant: ``_build_album_model`` must return the SAME
M_peak / era for every album of an artist once the complete catalogue is in
the DB (the state the two-pass guarantees at rating time) — the first album
scanned no longer sees a different benchmark from its siblings.
