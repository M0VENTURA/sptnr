"""Regression tests: single-artist compilations get MORE 5★ tracks.

A Greatest Hits / Best-Of album is a curated collection of the artist's
genuine hits, so it must NOT be rated like a normal album:

1. The 5★ album-top-N rank must use the ARTIST's catalogue reference, not
   the compilation's own (inflated) tracklist — otherwise only the top-3 of
   the compilation qualify and every other hit is suppressed.
2. The era 5★ slot cap (max_5star_slots) must NOT apply to single-artist
   compilations — a hits album legitimately holds many 5★ tracks.  True
   Various-Artists albums keep the cap.
