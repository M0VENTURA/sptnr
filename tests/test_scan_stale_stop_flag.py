"""Regression tests: stale stop flags + resume-stops-after-current-artist.

Reported issues:
1. "When resuming, it will only do the current artist and stop when running
   from the dashboard."
2. "When pressing stop to shut down the scan, any scan that tries to run
   after is immediately stopped again."

Root cause: a previous Stop leaves ``scan_states.stop_requested=True`` on the
scan type.  The dashboard "All" scan checks ``is_stop_requested(full_scan)``
every artist, but NOTHING cleared that flag when a new scan started — so the
new scan halted on its FIRST check (after doing exactly the resume-point
artist).  The fix clears stale stop flags at the START of every scan
(full_scan / library / popularity / mp3).

Verified here: ``_run_full_scan_as_artist_pipeline`` clears the stale
``full_scan`` stop flag before iterating, so a previous Stop no longer
instantly halts the next scan.
