"""Tests for the end-of-album file-tag fill + correction recording service.

Covers ``album_tag_sync_service``: at the end of an album metadata scan,
MISSING file tags are filled from the freshly scanned DB values (MBIDs only
when the album tracklist perfectly matches the MusicBrainz release), and
per-track corrections are recorded for file values that differ from what the
scan resolved.
