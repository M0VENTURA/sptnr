"""Regression tests: single-detection source gates after a primary confirm.

The user observed that once MusicBrainz confirms a track as a single, the
pipeline stopped checking some corroborating sources — the ``Matched:``
line only ever showed the sources checked before the gate fired.

Two gates were relaxed:

1. **ISRC lookup now runs for EVERY track with an ISRC**, even when
   MusicBrainz already confirmed via its release-group.  A track can be a
   single on one release while its recording's release-groups on other
   releases carry different primary types; the ISRC path (bounded to
   tracks that HAVE an ISRC, MB-cached) adds genuine cross-release
   corroboration.

2. **Discogs-video corroboration is configurable**: by default it still
   runs only when neither Discogs nor MusicBrainz confirmed (rate-limited
   Discogs API call); set
   ``single_detection.always_check_discogs_video: true`` to also run it
   after a primary confirm so a track that is BOTH an MB single AND has a
   Discogs video shows both.
