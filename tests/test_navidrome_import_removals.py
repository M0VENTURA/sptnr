"""Tests for Navidrome import stale-track removal (diff mode).

Regression: removing songs (or whole albums) from the Navidrome library never
deleted the corresponding rows from the Popularr database during a change
scan:

1. ``should_skip_cached_album`` skipped any album whose DB row count was
   >= the Navidrome count — exactly the removal case — so the per-album
   stale-track cleanup never ran for albums with removed songs.
2. Albums removed entirely from Navidrome never entered the album loop
   (and diff mode skips the artist-level stale cleanup), so their tracks
   stayed in the DB forever.
