"""Regression tests for two reported issues.

Issue 1 — track edit modal on the album page reported "database updated, but
tags weren't saved to file" while the track page worked.  Root cause:
``sync_track_tags_to_file`` looked up ``file_path`` from the ``get_track_tags``
dict, which only contains ``EDITABLE_FIELDS`` (``file_path`` is NOT one of
them), so the file path was always ``None`` and the sync always returned
``False``.  The fix resolves the path from the DB directly (with relative-path
handling) and only writes non-empty tags.

Issue 2 — no tracks became 5★ on the album "(how to live) as ghosts".  Root
cause: the bare ``\blive\b`` album pattern matched "live" inside the title
phrase, so the album was treated as a live album and ``_assign_stars`` capped
every track at 4★.  The fix restores the format-tag-only live patterns.
