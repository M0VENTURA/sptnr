"""Regression tests for download-completion matching of compilation albums.

The reported bug: downloads for compilation albums (e.g. "Greatest Hits") showed
as failed even though the files were present in the downloads folder. Two defects
combined to cause it:

1. ``_metadata_matches_queue_item`` hard-rejected files whose embedded artist tag
   was missing or a generic compilation placeholder ("Various Artists"/"VA"),
   even when the title matched and the filename was a perfect match.  The
   completion matching then skipped those files without trying filename scoring,
   so they were never imported and eventually marked failed.
2. ``_monitored_downloads_dir`` / the completion walk resolved the downloads
   directory with the ``Music`` subfolder preference, while the discovery scan
   that surfaces files on the monitor page scans the downloads root.  With a
   ``Music`` subfolder present, the completion walk never saw the downloaded
   files at all.
