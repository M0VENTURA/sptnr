"""Regression tests: Essential Collection .m3u creation per-artist scan section.

The runner must create/refresh an artist's essential collection at the END of
EVERY artist's section during a scan — not once at the end of the whole run.
Previously only artists that appeared in ``finalise_scan``'s ``results`` got a
collection, so a full/combined scan whose albums were mostly SKIPPED (inside
the skip window) never created or updated those artists' playlists.

Covers:
- ``_close_artist_essential_section`` creates the collection once per new
  artist, reuses the once-per-scan feat-track pool, and records the artist so
  ``finalise_scan`` doesn't re-do them.
- skipped/metadata-only scans still close out every artist section.
- ``finalise_scan`` skips artists the runner already handled
  (``options["_essential_playlists_done"]``) but still creates the rest.
