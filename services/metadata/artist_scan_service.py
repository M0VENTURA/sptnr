"""Artist scan service.

Responsible for external release comparison and scan orchestration.
DB persistence is delegated to repositories; network calls go through
the shared MusicBrainz client singleton.

Concurrency and outage behaviour:
- The full-library sweep visits every artist and browses MusicBrainz for
  each one. Running it while a popularity scan is active puts two
  independent consumers on the same 1 req/s MusicBrainz budget, which
  drove the server to 503 within seconds. The sweep now refuses to start
  while a popularity scan is running, and pauses if one starts mid-sweep.
- When the MusicBrainz client reports itself unavailable (circuit breaker
  open), the sweep waits instead of racing through the remaining artists
  turning every one into an empty result.
- An empty MusicBrainz response is never persisted as "nothing missing"
  unless the lookup genuinely succeeded. Persisting on failure deleted the
  artist's cached rows and silently emptied the missing-releases list.
