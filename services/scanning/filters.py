"""Pure scanning skip-decision helpers.

Pure functions for determining whether an album or artist should be
skipped during scanning based on filters, cache state, and mode flags.

Key Functions:
    - should_skip_album(): Check if an album should be skipped based on
      filter, missing flag, or diff mode.

Architecture:
    Pure functions with no side effects. No database access or state
    mutation. Used by the scanning pipeline to avoid unnecessary work.
