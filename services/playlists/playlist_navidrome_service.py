"""Navidrome playlist API wrapper.

Thin wrapper around ``NavidromeClient`` playlist operations for
interacting with the Navidrome Subsonic API.

Key Functions:
    - list_playlists(): Fetch all playlists from Navidrome.
    - load_playlist(): Get detailed playlist contents by ID.
    - create_navidrome_playlist(): Create a new playlist via the
      Subsonic ``createPlaylist`` endpoint.
    - sync_playlist_by_name(): Create OR update (in place) a playlist,
      deleting same-name duplicates so scans never recreate entries.

Used by:
    - Playlist WebUI routes for browsing and managing playlists.
    - Playlist sync workflows (Essential Collections, Genre Top Tracks,
      New Music — every generated playlist that must not duplicate).

Architecture:
    Delegates HTTP calls to ``api_clients.navidrome.NavidromeClient``.
    No business logic — pure API wrapper.

Change-detection contract:
    ``sync_playlist_by_name`` compares the playlist's CURRENT ordered song
    list against the requested list and returns ``unchanged=True`` without
    issuing a write when they already match.

    NOTE ON SHAPE: ``NavidromeClient.fetch_playlist`` pops the Subsonic
    ``entry`` key and re-exposes it as ``tracks``. Reading ``entry`` from
    that return value always misses, which made change detection report
    "current song list could not be read" for every playlist.
