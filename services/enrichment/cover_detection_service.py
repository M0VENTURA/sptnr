"""Cover song detection service.

Identifies cover songs using the ``CoverDetector`` class, which uses
MusicBrainz relations, writer/composer analysis, ISRC matching, and
heuristic title annotations.

Key Functions:
    - detect_covers_for_artist(): Scan all tracks for an artist and mark
      covers in the database.
    - detect_covers_for_album(): Detect covers within a single album (used
      during popularity scan).
    - detect_cover_song(): Quick single-track check used during popularity
      scanning.

Rebuilt with the following corrections:

- The row mapping in ``detect_covers_for_artist`` read ``composer`` (index 4)
  into the ``writer`` field and never read the real ``writer`` column
  (index 5), so writer-based attribution ran on the wrong data.
- ``detect_cover_song`` returned ``False`` for tracks it was only meant to
  skip, so a caller writing the verdict back cleared the flag on confirmed
  and manually-overridden covers. Skips now return the existing verdict.
- The second tuple element mixed normalised titles with reason strings. It is
  now always a reason; the normalised title is available separately.
- A songwriter differing from the performer no longer independently returns
  ``True``, since external songwriters are normal for commercial releases.
