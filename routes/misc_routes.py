    Runs when a search query proves ``album_artist``/``artist``/``title`` are
    absent (legacy bare table).  ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` is idempotent,
    so this converges on any starting state and is safe to run on every
    request until the columns exist.

    The ALTER targets bare ``tracks`` — the SAME table the artists / albums /
    tracks browse pages query (which provably work with album_artist).  An
    earlier version targeted the schema-qualified name
    (``resolve_table_qualified_name`` → ``public.tracks``), but the browse
    pages resolve bare ``tracks`` to a DIFFERENT physical table (the one
    WITH album_artist), so the qualified-name ALTER kept missing the real
    table and the error repeated forever.

    IMPORTANT: the ALTERs run UNCONDITIONALLY (no ``if col in existing``
    skip).  The column probe can disagree with reality (e.g. it resolves a
    different ``tracks`` via ``search_path``, or returns ORM-declared
    columns for a bare table), and a skip based on that wrong probe would
    permanently prevent the column from being added.  ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT
    EXISTS`` is a no-op when the column is already present, so unconditional
    execution is always safe.

    The ALTERs run in their OWN committed ``db_session`` each (a separate
    transaction per column) and the backfill in another.  PostgreSQL aborts
    the whole transaction when a statement errors — and SQLAlchemy marks the
    session for rollback on any SQL error even when the Python exception is
    caught — so a failing statement inside the same transaction would roll
    back the already executed ``ADD COLUMN`` statements and the heal would
    never persist (the "errors repeat forever" failure).  One transaction
    per statement guarantees each successful ALTER commits independently.
