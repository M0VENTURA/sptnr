"""Flask/Quart blueprint registration.

Central import-and-register for all API blueprints used by the app.
Called once during app factory setup (``helpers.app_bootstrap.register_all_blueprints``).

Architecture rules:
- Every new route module with a ``Blueprint`` must be added here.
- Blueprints can set ``url_prefix`` at registration time.
- No business logic is stored in this file.
